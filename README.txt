# CI/CD Pipeline for Healthcare Application

## Overview

This project implements a CI/CD pipeline for a healthcare application, enabling continuous integration and continuous delivery to enhance deployment efficiency and code quality.

## Objectives

- Automate the build, test, and deployment processes.
- Implement Infrastructure as Code for consistent deployments.
- Monitor application performance in real-time.

## Features

- **Version Control Integration:** Git for source management.
- **Automated Build Process:** Trigger builds automatically via GitHub Actions.
- **Automated Testing:** Use JUnit and JaCoCo for testing and coverage analysis.
- **Monitoring & Logging:** Real-time performance insights.
- **Rollback Mechanism:** Quick recovery from deployment failures.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- Version control integration
- Automated build and testing
- Monitoring and logging
- Rollback mechanism

### Non-Functional Requirements

- Scalability
- User-friendly interface
- Security (RBAC/encryption)
- Quick deployment speed (< 10 minutes)

## Technologies Used

- **GitHub Actions:** For automated workflows.
- **Docker:** For containerized deployments.
- **JUnit & JaCoCo:** For testing and code coverage.
- **Hamcrest:** For expressive assertions in tests.
- **VSCode:** Development environment.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Docker installed
- GitHub account
- Java Development Kit (JDK) for running tests

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
2. cd your-repo
3. docker build -t your-image-name .


1. docker run -p 8080:8080 your-image-name
2. Access the application at http://localhost:8080.

CI/CD Workflow
